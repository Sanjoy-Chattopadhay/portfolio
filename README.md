# Portfolio
My portfolio page is actually describing my Resume. You explore the web page with a jeep, and you can see information such as:
 
i. Education
#
ii. work experience
# 
iii. personal projects
# 
iv. social media handles where I am active.

I have made this website by HTML and css, and for styling ofcourse I have used Bootstrap and It was the javascript that are responsible for the Buttons and Dark Modes etc.
